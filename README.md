# BidWin
This is a bidding/auction web application, created for the sole purpose of my final thesis for University.
The project will consist of a bidding process, where the are two main users, the bidder and the auctioneer, and it is the classical interaction of, I sell something at a minimum value of X, and then the different bidders will have Y amount of time to bid for this item, so they can obtain it.

This project is a Headless CMS with Wagtail and React, it is divided in two parts, the front-end, which will be a React Webapp, which connect into an API and the backend, which is all made with Wagtail, this API will interact with all the functionalities of the webapp itself and return it to the WebApp - probably everything is going to be developed in typescript.

The back-end part, as the project must be done using Wagtail, it all would be developed in Python, and the the database with the information, the best fitted would SQL or PL/SQL.
